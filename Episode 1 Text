*Open* with a flyover of avenues and streets, all deserted. Closeup on an overturned __Nuts4Nuts__ stand, with the
umbrella rolling slowly through the street and coming to a stop. Big zoomout of the city, where we see the zombie
army moving south from the north. Ominous noises. Depressing music begins to play in the background.
Pan to 89th street, covered in fog. As it zooms in on Dalton, we
hear loud bangs and yells -- the normal sounds of robotics. Cut to 5th floor. There is yelling, chaos, people running
around. MSW and Charlie are trying to get the attention of the students as they are fighting.

MSW: "Guys! You're not getting anything done so I'm giving you an assessment because apparently your impending zombie **doom** is not sufficient to make you work together!"

Devin(in a fit of terror): "Oh no! Will it affect our grades?"

Liam: "Haha sucks for all of you that aren't into college and still have to think about grades."

MSW: "Your new assessment is seeing how lethal to zombies you can make your robot. This will be measured by speed, number of weapons included, and ultimately how many zombies you destroy."

Charlie: “Ok, Let’s get to work. First things first: we have to figure out what we will need and spend hundreds of dollars ordering them. Now, lets spend all of class making groups and sub groups!” 

All: “YEAH! Great plan!”

*All of the students stand around, questioning what exactly they are actually going to do. Andrew stands up, still focusing on the world championship that just happened

Andrew: "We actually did so well at World's, we are honestly so good guys, I don't even care about this new assessment."

Dillon (very upset): "ANDREW, focus!!"

*Zach, Andrew, and Dillon, Liam, and Devin all bicker in the corner ove possible methods for creating a robot lethal to the oncoming zombies
Small parts of the conversation are overheard:
"Are you kidding Andrew that's way too complicated!"
"Daniel, you know that isn't tetrix! START AUTONOMOUS ALREADY!"
"Liam, everyone already knows where you're going to college, we need to survive first though!"

*Emily enters with a large bag, baked goods inside.
Emily: "Guys stop fighting, I brought homemade cookies! They are so delicious!"

Charlie: "Let's start by barracading the stairwell, and disabling the elevator. That will give us more time to finish the robot, AKA extension, you're welcome!"

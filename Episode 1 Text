Closeup on an overturned **Nuts4Nuts** stand, with the umbrella rolling slowly through the street and coming to a stop.
Big zoomout of the city, where we see the zombie army moving south from the north. Ominous noises.
Pan to 89th street, covered in fog. 
As it zooms in on Dalton, we hear loud bangs and yells -- the normal sounds of robotics.
Cut to 5th floor. There is yelling, chaos, people running around. MSW and Charlie are trying to get the attention of 
the students as they are getting into fights.*

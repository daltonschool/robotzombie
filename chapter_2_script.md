here is a basic plot summary: okay so story: 1. they are building the robots with the zombies approaching 
2. there's a huge battle in the cafeteria, MSW, Charlie, and Gordie are clearly the leaders here until the three of them get eaten / turned into zombies 
3. the kids take over and use their knowledge of the school to fend for themselves and make weapons, here Nathaniel takes charge and makes something batman related. 
	Liam volunteers to go find the zombies and he gets eaten 
4. the final battle takes place and the children are victorious, because the zombies who turned them die everyone comes back and they're all one big happy family.

Dunno where Charlie, we'll figure that out later.

uber drivers became zombies. This is where it all starts

Possible robot designs: 
robot with a big stomper (literally a giant hammer on an arm)
cannonbot that shoots the zombies

Remember, don't get too dark

###**Episode 2**
######**A Few Days Later**

*Open* with a shot moving down the fifth floor hallway. Locker doors have been scorched, ripped off their hinges, and dented by the testing of various iterations of the students' robots. A flashback of the ending scence from Epsiode reminds us that Davis is still lost. The camera pans to the Cafeteria where it seems everyone in the building has been able to assemble. Students work furiously on their robots as the building gets hotter and the zombies are getting closer burning their way through the city. Gordie is reading the newspaper in the corner unaware of the current situation.   

The ominous music cuts out as the camera moves to MSW sitting at the other end of the table zooming in on MSW's face. His head snaps up as he looks away from his computer and the silence is interupted by a familiar order: 

*MSW*: "build robots!"

A group of students convene at the next table over. The freshman boys and Charlie DiPrinzio are in tears, simply dejected.

*Charlie DiPrinzio* : "Waaaaaaah! I'm sad!"

*Laeo* (suddenly serious): "Stop snivelling, Charlie! I know we experienced a tragic loss yesterday. He shouldn't have attracted the zombies by screaming after me and OtherBen in the staircase but once the zombies got Ryan there was nothing we could do about the fever. He's the reason we were all able to make it here."

*Makoto* : "We're safe for now, but we have a lot to do."

*Charlie* : "We have to organize! We need a group in charge of cooking, a building group, a coding group, a defense group, a team morale group, a prototyping group, a time wasting and distraction group, and a shift so that we can all do our tasks with maximum efficiency and work is being done around the clock."

*Julian* (looking at Charlie DiPrinzio): "Oh no! I forgot my home-made kale juice on the fifth floor! Do you want to come with me to get it?"

*Charlie DiPrinzio* : "Sure!"

*Julian* : "Ooooo...Noooo...I was talking to Ava..."

*Charlie DiPrinzio* : "Oh. Can I come anyway?"

*Charlie Forster* : "No! Two people is enough! We can't afford to lose three!"

Charlie ignores Charlie and tries to follow the others, but Makoto tackles him, preventing him from leaving. Julian and Ava reach the fifth floor and hear Davis' screams down to the end of the 5th floor, they start to run following the incessant stream of cries and wimpers. The camera switches to Davis, tears in his eyes, crumpled in a locker that he had survived in. 

*Julian* (preparing for the worst): "Davis, what happened?"

*Davis* (his bottom lip trembling): "Something tickled me!"

Julian, knowing the pain that Davis has endured rushes to his side, and helps him up. Suddenly a crash erupts from behind them. They rush back to where everyone is congregated telling them that the fifth floor is no longer safe. They had moved, even with Zach and Andrew clinging to their beloved robot, down to the Cafeteria just in time. 

Once down in the cafeteria everyone resumes what they were doing, except the fear of the zombies has increased and the freshmen are now balled on the floor sobbing. A slow and steady banging and clomping starts coming up the stairs. Everything seems hopeless and the kids fear for the worst.

*Julian* (in his hispanic accent to try to diffuse the tension, but no one see the humor in his "yoke") : "Guys this is like reaallly reaally bad."

Nathaniel inconspicuously creeps off into the darkness, a clever grin on his face...

Makoto and Daniel, still working on the robot, seem to make a great achievement, but it's too late. The zombies are approaching fast. 

*Gordie* (peering up from his newspaper, finally coming to terms with the situation he rises crying) : "It's time."

*Charlie*: "Bolt the doors, get the robots ready."

As the kids scramble to find anything to bolt the doors with, OtherBen is sitting in the middle of the floor, a clear obstacle playing on his phone, looking up every once in a while to ask "is there anything I can do?."

*Dillon* (looking up, fear in his eyes): "We have left all the tools upstairs, all we brought was a robot cart."

On queue the zombies start banging on the cafeteria doors, screeches erupt while kids fear for their lives. 

MSW: Quick! Disassemble the cart and block the doors.

They close off the cafeteria doors and postpone the zombies' entrance for a little, hoping to buy Mattori and Daniel some time while they fix the robot. Liam shouts, distracted by his desperate need for a power source: "PHONE CHARGER!" very loudly despite fear of attracting more zombies. As everyone tries to shush him, he looks over at a nearby table and finds an iPhone charger directly in front of him.

Just as the door starts breaking Mattori and Daniel figure out how to fix their power issue by hooking it up to Liam's new iPhone charger. Liam very reluctantly gives up his charger almost in tears dramatatically saying: "It is a sacrifice I am...will...ing to make." 

Andrew and Daniel, first passive-aggressively, then very aggressive, fight over who gets to line up their robot before the zombies come, but as they do this MSW, Charlie, and Gordie begin to pry the door open saying: "Okay, you guys have more than enough time to work, the assessment starts now whether you're ready or not." After a few minutes of struggling, they manage to get the door open and the zombies come pouring out.

The zombies have made their way over to the easiest target, the clump of freshemn on the floor. The room is filled with the sounds of a low growl, coming from the zombies, mixed with the sounds of children screaming, and suddenly a quiet song erupts from the background, as blond zombie erupts into song. Without hesitation Emily joins hands with what she thought to be her former friend Briteny, this potentially life threatening zombie, and starts dancing and singing along with her. Chris begins to dance to the music as he is bored waiting for action.

Gordie tries to hop on his vespa and scooter away, but the ignition just isn't cooperating with him and the zombies overtake him

Charlie realizes that he forgot his century old sourdough in the cafeteria and runs in to get it, he knows that he can't fend off all of the zombies, but he goes in anyways. 

MSW had taken too much cough medicine, in effort to get rid of his fever, and cannot process the situation before it's too late..

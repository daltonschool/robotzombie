  The students retreated into the computer science room. Still recovering from their lost man, the roboticists sat in   silence until the heard the sound a someone munching on skinnypop. The students looked up.
  
  "Liam!?" Emily said with a hopeful look.
  
  But it wasn't Liam. The students looked around the room only to find Westley squatted in the corner making goat   
  noises.

 "What" Westley said noticing the room was stairing at him. 
 
  The students looked away and sat, sulking.They knew they couldn't hold out much longer. The zombies were   
  approaching and although they did know the  school better, they were in no position to hold off an army of hungry 
  zombies. They had to think fast. The "Liam experience" was not one they wanted to repeat. Just as everyone was   
  beginning to fret, Nathaniel ran out of the  compsci lab flying! He had made himself a pair of batman wings.
  
  "Let's GOOOOOOO!!!" Nathaniel shouted as he flew through the hall. 
  
  The students stared at him in disbelief. This was just what they need. 
  
  "We've got this!" Shouted Kira, ditching her 3d model of a miniature pony. 
  "Let's go kill some zombies!" Mumbled Mattori, his mouth full of whole weat lox bagel. 
  
  While they were still mourning the loss of their loved one, the students proceeded full speed ahead. They
  ran to the elevator and waited. After a few minutes the elevator came and the students took it down to three.
  The doors opened and the students bursted out, Nathaniel flying forth at the head. 
  
  It was a heated battle. Shouts of pain were heard from both sides. For a while, it was unclear who was 
  in the lead. But after some time, it was evident that the children were losing. One by one the kids fell back, 
  while the zombies only got stronger. 
  
  All hope was lost. All those still conscious, knew they were going to lose. But then something happened. One of the
  most incredible things that has ever occurred. Just as the students were about to give up, Roby Dick rolled in
  with his three sidekicks Alexis of Atomic Theory, Jank Tank of Quantum Mechanics, and Brian Scalabrine of General Relativity. And all of a sudden, the tables turned. The 
  kids regained their strength and, with the help of their robots, were able to defeat the zombies. 
  
  After all of the zombies were dead, the five remaining kids ran upstairs with their robots following close behind. 
  Once they were upstairs and safe they mourned their losses of their valiant friends who were lost in the fight.

  Zach and Andrew wrapped their arms around the robot and began to cry softly into agent 4174.
  
  "Oh! How scared I was!" cried Zach as Andrew pulled the robot in for a closer embrace. 

  "Stop let me hug the robot!" Shouted Zach
  
  "GO AWAY. We're having a moment"  Said Andrew, stroking his baby.
  
  "ROBOT. ROBOT. ROBOT." repeated Zach as he scrambled around Andrew trying to touch the robot. 
  
  Zach took one final lunge for the robot and in an effort to maintain sole posseision, Andrew swung around and the robot flew through the air. Everyone stood in awe, staring as agent 4174 was flung across the room. As it plunged to it's death, Andrew and Zach began to yell.
  
  "The is all your fault" Yelled Andrew.
  "What are you talking about?" exclaimed Zach.
  
  The two continued in this manner until Dillon emerged from the crowd of students observing the fight. 
  
  "Guys," Dillon said as the voice of reason. "We need to stop arguing. We only have each other now." 
  
  Zach and Andrew looked up. They stopped bickering and tears filled all three of their eyes as they stood there and stared at their disheveled robot. In the midst of their greiving, the door was flung open! In flew the previously-dead students on Nathaniel's batman shoes. The students stared in disbelief, this couldn't be real life. 

  "What happened?" questioned Carisa. 
  "I'm so confused" stated Jack. 
  
  "While you were all busy fighting over your robot, Makoto made a dezombifier. Flying through the air on his batman wings, Nathaniel shot us with the gun and here we are!" exclaimed Ben. 
  
  "Can you save the robot?" yelled Andrew impatiently.
  
  "No, no, Andrew. This is a great story for the judging interview! How we rose from a zombie attack all the way to worlds. They won't even ask about our budget!" said Zach.
  
  Then, out of nowhere, other Ben comes into the room playing an intense game of Flappy Birds. Ella grabs his phone out of his hand and is about to throw it across the room. But just then, she notices the game, and sits down and begins to play in the corner, breaking ben's high score in a matter of seconds. #girlpower
  
  From behind the air conditioner a disheveled and wounded Christina Aguilera emerges. She steps on top of the robots and begins to sing Beautiful. Andrew whimpers.

then finally Charlie MSW and Gordie walk in, and they all sit as one happy family

A battered robot, Brian Scalabrine, rolls into the Cafeteria as all the students and teachers are watching. Loaded into its launcher is... a bomb! Even without a face, you can see that the still oblivious and now-sentient Scalabrine believes that by launching this bomb, it will save the day and kill the zombies. Dylan and Robert rush up to the robot, and, after a few minutes, convince that the zombie threat is no longer an issue within the school. Brian goes to launch the bomb out the window, so that it will not harm any of the kids inside the building. Yet, Brian Scalibrine being Brian Scalibrine, the robot plops down the bomb a few feed from its launcher; no where near the window. As Davis shouts, "NOOOOOO," the bomb explodes, taking the children with them. 
TWENTY YEARS LATER
Robert Downey Jr. is seen walking across the aftermath in the future, and the dissapointment is visible on his face, as he shouts, "SCALIBRINE!!!!"
